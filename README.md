# IoT-Based Transport and Monitoring of Goods

**Description:**  
A real-time monitoring system for goods in transit using IoT sensors and cloud integration. It tracks temperature, humidity, and motion, and sends alerts when anomalies are detected.

**Tech Stack:**  
- ESP8266 NodeMCU  
- DHT11 (Temperature & Humidity Sensor)  
- Vibration Sensor  
- Blynk App or MQTT  
- Cloud Dashboard

**Features:**  
- Real-time temperature and humidity monitoring  
- Vibration detection for shock/motion alerts  
- Cloud-based dashboard visualization  
- Mobile notifications

**How it Works:**  
Sensors capture data during transport. ESP8266 uploads it to the cloud. Alerts are generated if thresholds are crossed or vibration is detected.

**Code:**  
See `main.ino` for sample code.
